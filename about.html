	<p class="about">Hello! My name is Gabe and I am a sophomore Computer Science major and French minor at the University of San Francisco. First off, I would like to thank you for taking the time to explore my website! I built it entirely from scratch and for me this is a big accomplishment since I am relatively new to the whole Computer Science scene.<br></p>

	<p class="about">I am a Bay Area native and grew up in Vallejo (first half of my childhood) and the lovely beach town of Pacifica, California. Growing up I enjoyed many activites including long distance running which takes up a majority of my free time. I was a competitive runner in high school and contiue to sign up for races today. In addition to running, something unexpected about myself is that I speak French as a second language. I started learning the language in high school and have since, continued to study the language and culture at USF. Other hobbies of mine include lugging my camera around and taking pictures (in other words, I love photography) and occasionally making cool videos with my GoPro. Oh, and I love playing the piano! I am a classically trained pianist since the age of 5. I swear, sometimes busting out a random Chopin Waltz is the most satisfying thing ever!<br></p>

	<p class="about">Anyways as I mentioned, I am relatively new to the whole Computer Science scene. You are probably wondering why I am a Computer Science major in the first place. Well...my major is a somewhat complicated story. When I was in high school, I wanted to become a medical doctor, thinking that I could combine my passion for running into a career. However, upon applying to college and deciding to attend USF, I decided to major in International Business given my interest in French and my past experience traveling to Europe for a small immersion program. Besides, I could still go to medical school as long as I passed the MCAT and completed all the class requirements for med school right? RIGHT! It was not until I had the opportunity to intern for a small startup after my freshman year at USF that got me interested in Computer Science. I was a Marketig intern however, I was surrouned by four other conputer scientists 8 hours a day for three months. I remember in middle school I learned basic HTML and designed my own website in computer class but that was the extent of my computer science knowledge. After interning and working on software products all summer, I decided to take an intro CS class as an elective thinking that I could possibly pick up a CS minor. Well, after a month in that class, I was certain that I wanted to switch my major. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why Computer Science excites me. Perhaps it's the fact that I am learning how to program devices that millions of people use everyday. Or maybe it's the fact that I can create a program that makes life just a little bit easier. Regardless, with Computer Science, the sky is the limit. And plus, sometimes I like to pretend that I am working on a top secret assignment behind my monitor (because it sure looks like it)!<br></p>
