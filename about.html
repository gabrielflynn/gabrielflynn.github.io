		<p class="description3">Hello! My name is Gabe and I am a junior Business Administration major and French minor at the University of San Francisco. First off, I would like to thank you for taking the time to explore my website! I built it entirely from scratch and for me this is a big accomplishment. I was previously a Computer Science major and I still have a keen interest for how programming works and design through programming.<br></p>

		<p class="description3">I am a Bay Area native and grew up in the lovely beach town of Pacifica, California. Growing up I enjoyed many activities including long distance running which takes up a majority of my free time. I was a competitive runner in high school and continue to sign up for races today. In addition to running, something unexpected about myself is that I speak French as a second language. I started learning the language in high school and have since, continued to study the language and culture at USF. Other hobbies of mine include lugging my camera around and taking pictures (in other words, I love photography) and Current Events! I am the co-Founder of the Current Events Club at USF and you can always find me raving about something that happened on the news that I learned through some social media outlet. Oh also, I love playing the piano! I am a classically trained pianist since the age of 5. I swear, sometimes busting out a random Chopin Waltz is the most satisfying thing ever!<br></p>

		<p class="description3">I hope you enjoyed getting to know me a little better. Please explore around to learn more. If you click on the Portfolio tab above, you can see some of the extracurricular activities and projects I have completed.</p>
